# Action Potential


Action Potential is a mobile game that utilises third party EEG sensor data written in unity and python.

Originally written for [Brain Hackathon 2016](http://abc-accelerator.com/budapest-hackathon/), where we have manage to win the Qusp prize of 1000USD.

Scope for Qusp prize:

Integration of wearable EEG brain sensing into mobile, PC, and web-based apps and games (including AR/VR), robotic systems, or the Internet of Things using the Qusp NeuroPype or NeuroScale platforms.


### Tech

Action Potential uses these technologies:

* neuropype.io - Environment for real-time brain-computer interfacing, neuroimaging, and general biosignal processing.
* neuroscale.io - The first scalable real-time platform for processing EEG and other biosignals in the cloud. Anytime. Anywhere.
* unity3d.com - Game engine.

### Installation

Dependencies:
* neuropype dependencies
* neuroscale dependencies
* unity3d
